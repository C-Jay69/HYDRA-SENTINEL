# Outstanding Work for Publishable Platform

This document outlines the outstanding work required to make the platform publishable.

## Backend

### 1. Implement Real Data in Admin Analytics

*   **File:** `backend/routes/admin.py`
*   **Issue:** The admin analytics endpoints (`/stats/dashboard`, `/analytics/revenue`, `/analytics/signups`, `/analytics/subscriptions`) are currently returning mock data. These need to be updated to query the database and return real data.

### 2. Fix Potential Race Condition in User Creation

*   **File:** `backend/database.py`
*   **Issue:** The `create_user` method checks for an existing user and then calls `create_one`, which could lead to a race condition where two users with the same email are created simultaneously. This should be handled by a unique index in the database and proper error handling.

### 3. Implement Security Log Endpoint

*   **File:** `backend/routes/admin.py`
*   **Issue:** The frontend's Admin Panel attempts to fetch security logs from a `/api/admin/security-logs` endpoint, but this endpoint does not exist. This endpoint needs to be created.

### 4. Implement User Management Actions

*   **File:** `backend/routes/admin.py`
*   **Issue:** The user management actions in the Admin Panel (suspend, delete) are not implemented in the backend. Endpoints need to be created to handle these actions.

### 5. Correct User ID Handling in `get_user_profile`

*   **File:** `backend/routes/auth.py`
*   **Issue:** The `get_user_profile` function has a try-except block to handle both string and ObjectId formats for the user ID. This is not ideal and should be standardized.

## Frontend

### 1. Display All Fetched Data on Dashboard

*   **File:** `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx`
*   **Issue:** The `Dashboard.jsx` component fetches a wide range of data, but not all of it is displayed. The `locations`, `callLogs`, `messages`, `apps`, and `webHistory` states are fetched but not used in the UI.

### 2. Correct User Filtering in Admin Panel

*   **File:** `frontend/src/pages/AdminPanel.jsx`
*   **Issue:** The user filtering in the Admin Panel is based on a non-existent `username` field. This should be corrected to filter by `name` or `email`.

### 3. Connect User Management Actions to Backend

*   **File:** `frontend/src/pages/AdminPanel.jsx`
*   **Issue:** The user management actions in the Admin Panel (`suspend`, `delete`) are not connected to any backend API calls. These need to be implemented to call the new backend endpoints.
