The AI engineer successfully initiated the development of a full-stack parental control application, ParentGuard, cloning mspy.com functionality with custom brand colors. The process involved an iterative approach, starting with a React-based frontend using mock data, followed by extensive backend development with FastAPI and MongoDB for user management, child monitoring data, and authentication. Multiple bug fixes were performed to address React rendering errors, JWT authentication, and database query mismatches, leading to a functional dashboard and child management system. Stripe integration was implemented, though live payments await user's account activation. Currently, the engineer is building a React Native mobile monitoring app as the next major component, following a detailed plan discussed with the user.

<product_requirements>
The user requested an exact clone of mspy.com, a comprehensive full-stack parental control platform. Key requirements included:
- **Functionality**: Exact replica of mspy.com, including all interactive elements, navigation, and page transitions.
- **Design**: Pixel-perfect clone, but with custom brand colors (Blue: #0000FF, Gold/Mustard: #FFBF00, Magenta/Fuchsia: #FF00FF, Cyan: #00FFFF, Light Gray: #DCDFD5) and a modern layout.
- **Architecture**: Full-stack application with React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database.
- **Features**:
    - **User Authentication**: Login/registration for parents.
    - **Dashboard**: For parents to monitor children's activities.
    - **Child Management**: Ability to add and select children.
    - **Payment Portal**: Integration with Stripe for subscription plans.
    - **Admin Panel**: A separate, role-based access for analytics and editing.
    - **Mobile Monitoring App**: A component to be installed on the child's phone for data collection.
The implementation so far has delivered a functional web dashboard, user authentication, child management (add, select, display data), a billing page with Stripe integration (awaiting live keys), and initial admin panel structure.

<pending_tasks>
- **Stripe Account Activation**: The user needs to activate their Stripe account for live charges. The integration itself is technically complete.
- **Mobile Monitoring App Development**: The React Native child monitoring app is currently in its initial setup phase and requires full implementation of its core features.
- **Admin Panel Implementation**: The admin panel ( route) is set up with basic files but requires full functionality for analytics and editing.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was starting the development of the **ParentGuard Child Monitor App**, a React Native application intended for installation on the child's device. This app will integrate with the existing FastAPI backend to provide monitoring functionality.

The current work involves:
1.  **Project Setup**: Initializing the React Native project structure.
2.  **File Creation**:
    *   : Created to define project metadata and dependencies for the React Native app.
    *   : Created as the main entry point for the React Native application.
    *   : Created to handle data collection from the child's device (e.g., calls, SMS, location).
    *   : Created to manage API communication between the mobile app and the FastAPI backend.

The parent dashboard web application is largely functional. All previous critical bugs related to React rendering, JWT authentication, child addition, child selection, and payment portal integration (API calls) have been addressed. The Stripe integration is technically complete and uses the user's provided live keys, but actual live charges are currently blocked due to the user's Stripe account requiring verification.

<optional_next_step>
Continue building the React Native child monitoring app as per the plan.
